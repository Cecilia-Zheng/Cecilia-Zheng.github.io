/* Comment: There may be some codes that I have put as a comment as I decided to not use them in this assignment, however I would like to keep them for future references. Please ignore them.

Background colour: I chose a simple dark colour theme as the background of the page as my border colours are very colourful. Having a dark colour as the background can make the brighter colours more appealing. Instead of having a plain solid colour, I coded a gradient to make it more interesting but still having a good balance between dark and bright colours.

Padding: I included a padding of 10px as I didnt want my grid-boxes to touch the edge of the page.

/*Comment: I chose Akira Vol 1 - page 167 as my reference image.

Grid layout: I used gridlayoutit.com to plan my layout and divided the page into 4 columns and 5 rows. These columns and rows make it easy to create the layout as all the grid-boxes are in different sizes. I divided the page into 3 main rows and then included another row (the 2nd row) due to the thin rectangle box. The columns were slightly more confusing. I used the sides of the three vertical rectangle boxes as my columns.

Gaps: I also included a row gap of 13px and column gap of 6px as I noticed in the reference image that the row gaps are wider than the column gaps.

Colour palette: I chose a rainbow colour palette as this week is pride week. :D (I also find rainbow colours an appealing palette in general.)

Border: I want to make the border more noticeable therefore I designed the border-style as solid with 6px. I created a gradient border rather than a solid colour for each grid-box to add more complexity and appeal.
