      <!--Background music is from Adobe Stock Royalty Free Music: https://stock.adobe.com/au/search/audio?k=538663315 
          Comment: I included a background music to create a creepy atmosphere. Without the music, I find the website too bland. Adding sound should enhance user's experience with the web page. It is also Halloween themed audio which is coming up soon (or maybe it just past) so I guess it's perfect. Happy Halloween! :D
        NOTE: make sure browser sound setting is on "allow" or the music will not appear.-->
      <audio autoplay loop>
        <source src="sound/bgmusic.mp3"/>
      </audio>

      <!-- Comment: I wanted the user to turn the light off when they enter the web page, therefore I included a small text as a hint. I needed the lamp to be clicked three as the next text will only show on the second time. I tried to code them in one click however, it did not work out. This is the closest I could get to.

      I included another text on the right so that the user can know their aim is to explore the room by hovering and clicking certain areas. I didn't want to give too much text as the point of this web page is to allow the user to explore around.-->

<!-- Comment: The button to change the background image to light or dark version-->
    <button type="button" onclick="change()" id="btnID">change </button>

    <!-- Comment: I have also included an audio. This is the audio for the window. I thought only having buttons might be too boring and so adding a source of audio other than the background music could be more interesting. Furthermore, rather than using onclick again, I used mouseover and mouseout for the audio. As I wanted to includ different interactions for the user.
    
    Audio was from Freesound: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/405561/ -->

<!-- Comment: After a button has been clicked on once, they will not work again unless the website is refreshed. This gives an illusion that there was something in the room but also not. -->
