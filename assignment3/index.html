      <!--Background music is from Adobe Stock Royalty Free Music: https://stock.adobe.com/au/search/audio?k=538663315 
          Comment: I included a background music to create a creepy atmosphere. Without the music, I find the website too bland. Adding sound should enhance user's experience with the web page.
        NOTE: make sure browser sound setting is on "allow" or the music will not appear.-->

      <!-- Comment: I wanted the user to turn the light off when they enter the web page, therefore I included a small text as a hint. I needed the lamp to be clicked three as the next text will only show on the second time. I tried to code them in one click however, it did not work out. This is the closest I could get to.

      I included another text on the right so that the user can know their aim is to explore the room by hovering and clicking certain areas. -->

    <!-- Comment: I have also included an audio. This is the audio for the window. I thought only having buttons might be too boring and so adding a source of audio other than the background music could be more interesting.-->
