              Hosono is the grandson of <a href="">Masabumi Hosono</a>, the only Japanese passenger and survivor of the sinking of <a href="">RMS <i>Titanic</i></a>. 
              Hosono first came to attention in Japan as the bass player of the <a href="">psychedelic rock</a> band Apryl Fool, alongside drummer 
              <a href="">Takashi Matsumoto</a>, who released the album <i>The Apryl Fool</i> in 1969. Hosono and Matsumoto then formed the influential 
              <a href="">folk rock</a> group <a href="">Happy End</a> with <a href="">Eiichi Ohtaki</a> and <a href="">Shigeru Suzuki</a>.<a href="#cite-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> One of the songs he composed for Happy End, 
              "<a href="">Kaze wo Atsumete</a>" (1971), later appeared in the American film <a href=""><i>Lost in Translation</i></a> and on <a href="">its soundtrack</a> 
              in 2003.<a href="#cite-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> After <i>Happy End</i> disbanded around 1974, Hosono worked with Suzuki and a loose association of artists making 
              "<a href="">exotica</a>"-style music under the title <i>Tin Pan Alley</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              His involvement in <a href="">electronic music</a> also dates back to the early 1970s, when he performed the <a href="">electric bass</a> for 
              <a href="">Inoue Yousui</a>'s folk <a href="">pop rock</a> album <i>Ice World</i> (1973) and <a href="">Osamu Kitajima</a>'s <a href="">progressive</a>/psychedelic rock 
              album <a href=""><i>Benzaiten</i></a> (1974), both of which were <a href="">electronic rock</a> records utilizing synthesizers, electric guitars, and 
              in the latter, <a href="">electronic drums</a> and <a href="">rhythm machines</a>.<a href="#cite-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a><a href="#cite-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1977, Hosono invited <a href="">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> and <a href="">Yukihiro Takahashi</a> to work on his <a href="">exotica</a>-flavoured album <a href=""><i>Paraiso</i></a>, 
              which included electronic music produced using the <a href="">Yamaha CS-80</a> <a href="">polyphonic synthesizer</a> and <a href="">ARP Odyssey</a> synthesizer. 
              The band was named "Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band" and, having been recorded in late 1977, <i>Paraiso</i> was released in early 1978.<a href="#cite-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> 
              The three worked together again for the 1978 electronic album <i>Pacific</i>, which included an early version of the song "Cosmic Surfin'".<a href="#cite-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1978, he released an innovative electronic soundtrack for a <a href="">fictional</a> <a href="">Bollywood</a> film, <i>Cochin Moon</i>, together with artist 
              <a href="">Tadanori Yokoo</a> and future YMO band members Ryuichi Sakamoto and <a href="">Hideki Matsutake</a>. Inspired by a trip to India and "the exotic, 
              luxurious, and seemingly wonder-filled scenarios played out in <a href="">Indian cinemas</a>", it was an experimental "electro-exotica" album <a href="">fusing</a> 
              exotic <a href="">Indian music</a> (reminiscent of <a href="">Ravi Shankar</a> and <a href="">Bollywood music</a>) with electronic music, including an early "<a href="">synth</a> 
              <a href="">raga</a>" song entitled "Hum Ghar Sajan" (from a <a href="">Guru Granth Sahib</a> phrase).<a href="#cite-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The same year, he contributed to Sakamoto's song 
              "1000 Knives" for his solo album, <a href=""><i>Thousand Knives</i></a>, which experimented with fusing electronic music with traditional Japanese music in early 1978.<a href="#cite-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              He was one of the first producers to recognize the appeal of <a href="">video game sounds and music</a>. YMO's self-titled debut in 1978 contained 
              substantial video game sounds and after YMO disbanded an early project was an album simply titled <i>Video Game Music</i> containing mixed and 
              edited <a href="">Namco</a> <a href="">arcade game</a> music and sounds. <i>Video Game Music</i> was released in 1984 as an early example of a <a href="">chiptune</a> record<a href="#cite-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> 
              and the first video game music album.<a href="#cite-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> That same year, he also produced the theme song for <a href="">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s popular <a href="">anime</a> film 
              <a href=""><i>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</i></a>, "Kaze no Tani no Naushika", with vocals by actress-singer <a href="">Narumi Yasuda</a>.<a href="#cite-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> In the late 80s 
              and early 90s, the influence of <a href="">world music</a> on his music deepened, and he worked with international singers and musicians such as <a href="">Amina Annabi</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has produced a number of short-term band projects as a band member. His first post-YMO band was Friends of Earth. As with most of his projects 
              he combines musical styles he's interested in. F.O.E. seemed to be a combination of funk and techno, and included a collaboration with <a href="">James Brown</a> 
              and <a href="">Maceo Parker</a> for a remake of the song "<a href="">Sex Machine</a>". Another notable band project was 1995's Love, Peace & Trance. Members were 
              <a href="">Mimori Yusa</a> ("Love"), Miyako Koda ("Peace"), Haruomi Hosono ("&") and Mishio Ogawa ("Trance").
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1990s he started the <a href="">Daisyworld</a> label to release a wide range of experimental artists from Japan and the rest of the world. Hosono 
              collaborated on many of the releases, such as <a href="">World Standard</a>, a trip into Americana; HAT, a supergroup (the acronym stands for Hosono, 
              <a href="">Atom Heart</a>, <a href="">Tetsu Inoue</a>), and "Quiet Logic", by <a href="">Mixmaster Morris</a> and <a href="">Jonah Sharp</a>. <a href="">The Orb</a> also paid tribute 
              with a series of remixes including the notorious "Hope You Choke on Your Whalemeat".

              In 2002 Haruomi formed the duo <a href="">Sketch Show</a> with his YMO bandmate <a href="">Yukihiro Takahashi</a>. They have released two albums, one of which, 
              <i>Loophole</i>, has received a UK release. When the third former YMO member, <a href="">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> deepened his involvement it was decided 
              to bill those collaborations as <a href="">Human Audio Sponge</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the spring of 2007, his fellow YMO members and other artist paid tribute to Haruomi with a 2-disc album titled <i>Tribute to Haruomi</i>. 
              That same year, the animated film <a href=""><i>Appleseed Ex Machina</i></a> was released featuring a soundtrack performed and supervised by Hosono.
            </p>
            <p>
              In September 2010 he performed at the De La Fantasia festival and played songs from his upcoming album.
            </p>
            <p>
              In February 2011 it was announced that his new album, entitled <i>HoSoNoVa</i>, was to be released on April 20. He also performed a special 
              concert to celebrate its release.
            </p>
            <p>
              In May 2018, <a href="">Light in the Attic Records</a> announced a CD and vinyl reissue of five of Hosono's albums—<i>Hosono House</i>, <i>Cochin Moon</i>, 
              <i>Paraiso</i>, <i>Philharmony</i> and <i>omni Sight Seeing</i>—for release in August and September 2018. The former four albums had never been released 
              outside of Japan previously. Coinciding was the announcement that Hosono would play his first UK concerts as a solo artist in June; the shows were 
              scheduled as part of Sakamoto's MODE festival happening throughout England in June and July. The June 23 concert at the <a href="">Barbican Centre</a> in 
              London featured an appearance by his YMO bandmates, with whom he performed his <i>Solid State Survivor</i> composition "Absolute Ego Dance".
            </p>
            <p>
              2019 marked Hosono's 50th anniversary in the music industry. On March 6, he released <i>Hochono House</i>, a mostly electronic remake of his solo debut 
              <a href=""><i>Hosono House</i></a> that reversed the track listing. That spring, he performed his first solo shows in the U.S. This run included two sold-out 
              shows at the <a href="">Gramercy Theatre</a> in New York City and a concert at the <a href="">Mayan Theater</a> in Los Angeles. The second New York show saw an appearance 
              by current NYC resident <a href="">Akiko Yano</a>, who collaborated with Hosono in Tin Pan Alley, as a live support member of YMO, and as a solo artist; she sang 
              Hosono's "Ai Ai Gasa", which she covered on her 1977 album <i>Iroha Ni Konpeitou</i>. In LA, Canadian indie rock musician <a href="">Mac DeMarco</a>—whose vocal 
              admiration of Hosono has spread to a portion of his own fanbase—appeared during the show to perform "Honey Moon" as a duet with Hosono; Light in the 
              Attic had recently released a cover of the song on a 7" single record, backed with the original version.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the autumn of 2019, an exhibition on Hosono's career—"Hosono Sightseeing"—was on display in Tokyo Sky View at the <a href="">Roppongi Hills Mori Tower</a>; 
              along with other memorabilia, this featured many of the instruments associated with Hosono, such as the <a href="">Roland TR-808</a>, <a href="">E-mu Emulator</a>, 
              and <a href="">Prophet-5</a>. A documentary film, No Smoking, was also released, including footage from the U.S. and UK shows; appearances include Sakamoto, 
              Takahashi, Demarco, longtime friend <a href="">Van Dyke Parks</a>, and protégé <a href="">Gen Hoshino</a>.
